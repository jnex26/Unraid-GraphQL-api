# Unraid-GraphQL-api
This is an attempt at getting a ESP32 to query a graphQL 

you will need your own creds.h file to compile and build... these are the following definitions you will need 

const char* ssid = STASSID;

const char* password = STAPSK;

const char* unraidapiey = UNRAIDAPI;

const char* unraidapi = UNRAIDURL;


tested on ESP32-S3 ESP32-C3...
